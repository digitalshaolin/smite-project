Smite Nexus. A passion project I made for the Smite community. 

I always wanted a tool where I could easily see the latest builds from Smite SPL pro players. 

At that point nothing existed that gave me what I wanted and what I knew many other players would want as well, so I made it myself. 

Made with Next.js and the Smite API. All match/build information is fetched every 15 minutes from the Smite API so the information is always up to date.
